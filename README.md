# login_regester_page
Create a login and register page using Express, EJS, MySQL, and Redis. I use Sequelize to connect to MySQL, ioredis to connect to Redis, and Express as the server framework. EJS is used as the template engine. In this project, Redis is utilized to manage tokens with a 30-minute expiration time. After successful authentication, the user is redirected to the dashboard.
